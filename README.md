# DiscordDeleteBOT
A Bot's source code, it's purpose is for it to be triggered using a shash command and the amount of messages the user wants to delete, and poof, it's gone!

To note that this bot doesn't support the proper built-in Slash command within discord, but rather has the prefix "/". Thus making it incapable of rewarding the bot owner with the Active Developer badge.
